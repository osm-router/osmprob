# Introduction

When using routing algorithms to model movement on a graph, one is not necessarily interested in obtaining the least-cost, but the most
realistic results. The average path between any two points is likely never the shortest, yet there is currently no way to estimate the course or
lengths of realistic paths. Instead, movement is often assumed to be singular and repeatable.  **osmprob** is an *R* library that provides
routing probabilities along all possible paths between any two points.  The path of highest probability is the shortest, yet all edges will
generally have non-zero probabilities of being traversed.  Importantly, the resultant network enables calculation of the probabalistically most
likely distance travelled between any two points. The package comes with a built-in **Shiny** **Leaflet** application to display the results in
a matter that is both understandable and visually pleasing.
